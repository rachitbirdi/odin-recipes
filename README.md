# odin-recipes

This project is a simple recipe website. The main index page will have links to recipes that I'd like to share with you. 

Through this project I want to show myself and you guys what I have learned and how much I still need to learn.

Learning from the project - I learned how to use HTML boilerplate tags, create different headings with the help of <h1> and <h2> tag, make unordered and ordered list with <ul>,<ol> and <li>, add different links to link pages by anchor element <a href>, add images with <img> tag and adjust the images with height and width attribute, and commit changes to git.
